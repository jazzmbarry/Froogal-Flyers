                <h3>Which day of the week is the best day to buy airline tickets?</h3>
                    <p>
                        For both U.S. domestic and international travel, Sundays can be cheaper* for plane ticket purchases. 
                        For domestic flights, Mondays showed the highest average ticket prices and for international, avoid booking on Fridays.
                        Booking on the right day of the week could save you up to 20% on your flight*, according to historical data.
                    </p>
            </li>       
            <li>
                <h3>How far ahead should I buy airline tickets?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Based on 2019 global flight data, 21 days prior to departure* is the sweet spot for booking flights.
                        But this isn't a hard-and-fast rule; keeping an eye on prices is a good idea when trying to find the best deal.
                        Compare fares across different airlines and set up a price alert for your preferred route.

                <h3>Which are the cheapest days to fly?</h3>
                <p>
                    Analysis of domestic and international airfare prices showed that flying out on Sundays can be cheaper*.
                    Many travelers start their trips on Friday or Saturdays, so your chances of lower prices are better when departing
                    earlier in the week. Starting your trip on a Sunday could be almost 24% cheaper* than air travel on Fridays, so book away!

                <h3>Which is the cheapest month to fly?</h3>
                <p>
                    The cheapest month to fly can vary depending on where you're going, so finding the best rates largely
                    comes down to avoiding peak travel times for you destination. A great insider tip is to travel during shoulder
                    season - a name for the window of time between a destination's high and low tourist seasons. These are the best times to score better rates
                    and still enjoy temperate weather. Peak times that tend to be pricier no matter where you're headed are June
                    and July; due to the summer break schedule for families, and December, around Christmas and New Year's.

                <h3>How can I save money on flights?</h3>
                <p>
                    Mixing and matching airlines and fare types could help save money on airfare to your destination.
                    Easily compare prices on carriers, arrival and departure dates, airplane cabin class, and more when you book with Froogle
                    Flyers. Booking your plane ticket on a Sunday, and departing on a Thursday or Friday, could save you money!
